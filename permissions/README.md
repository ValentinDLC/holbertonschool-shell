ðŸ“‚ README â€” Shell Permissions (Linux/Unix)

ðŸ§¾ Introduction

This document explains the basics of file and directory permissions in Unix/Linux systems. It covers how to read, understand, and modify permissions using the Shell. Understanding permissions is critical for maintaining security and proper access control in any Linux environment.

ðŸ“Œ Permission Structure

Each file or directory has a set of permissions. You can view them using:

ls -l
Example output:

-rwxr-xr--
Breakdown:
Position	Meaning
1	File type (- = file, d = dir, l = link)
2-4	Owner (user) permissions
5-7	Group permissions
8-10	Others (world) permissions
Permission Characters:
Symbol	Meaning
r	Read
w	Write
x	Execute
-	No permission
ðŸ”§ Changing Permissions

Using chmod
chmod [permissions] [file]
Symbolic Mode:

chmod u+x file      # Add execute to user
chmod g-w file      # Remove write from group
chmod o=r file      # Set read-only for others
Numeric Mode:

Number	Permissions	Binary
0	---	000
1	--x	001
2	-w-	010
3	-wx	011
4	r--	100
5	r-x	101
6	rw-	110
7	rwx	111
Example:

chmod 755 script.sh   # rwxr-xr-x
ðŸ‘¤ Ownership

View ownership:
ls -l
Shows the owner and group of the file.

Change owner:
chown username file
chown username:group file
ðŸ”’ Special Permissions

Permission	Symbol	Description
Setuid	s on user execute	Run as file owner
Setgid	s on group execute	Run as group
Sticky bit	t on others execute	Only owner can delete (e.g., /tmp)
Apply with:

chmod u+s file    # setuid
chmod g+s file    # setgid
chmod +t dir      # sticky bit
âœ… Best Practices

Never give 777 unless absolutely necessary.
Use the least privilege principle.
Regularly audit file permissions with find and ls.
ðŸ§  Quick Tips

Use umask to set default permissions for new files.
Use stat file for detailed file metadata.
Combine chown and chmod in scripts to automate permission management.
