Shell, I/O Redirections, and Filters

📚 Overview

This module introduces essential concepts in Unix Shell, focusing on input/output (I/O) redirections, pipes, and text processing filters. Mastering these tools is crucial for automating tasks, managing files, and chaining powerful utilities to process data efficiently from the command line.

📘 Topics Covered

Introduction to the Shell and its environment
Standard streams: stdin, stdout, and stderr
I/O redirection operators:
> (redirect output)
>> (append output)
< (redirect input)
2> (redirect standard error)
Pipes (|) and command chaining
Useful command-line filters:
cat, head, tail
cut, sort, uniq
grep, wc, tr, sed, awk
🛠️ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Redirect input and output streams in Bash scripts or interactive sessions.
Chain multiple commands using pipes for complex data processing.
Use filters to manipulate, transform, and analyze text files.
Understand and separate standard output from standard error.

🧪 Example Commands

# Redirect output to a file
echo "Hello World" > hello.txt

# Append output to an existing file
echo "Another line" >> hello.txt

# Redirect input from a file
cat < hello.txt

# Redirect standard error
ls non_existing_file 2> error.log

# Pipe and filter: Count unique words in a file
cat file.txt | tr   n | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
🧠 Tips

Combine grep, cut, and sort for quick data analysis.
Use man to learn about any command (e.g., man awk).
Practice writing one-liners to automate small tasks.
